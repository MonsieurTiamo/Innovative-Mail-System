# Innovative-Mail-System
A mail system that can achieve customized functions

This email system is often used in situations where customized emails need to be sent in bulk. The user should have an excel file containing at least two columns, “nickname” and “receiver email”, and a folder with only three images to be transferred. Simply put, the system loops back to each mailbox in your excel file and sends an email with the corresponding designation.Both the subject and the content of the email can be personalized.

Caution:
1. Google Mail may hide the body text when it contains larger memory images, i.e. the recipient needs to download the original email to see the content.
2. When too many emails are sent in a loop, Google Mail may block the mailbox, which can only be restored after 24 hours. However, according to the regulations, mailboxes blocked and controlled for such a reason are able to be restored, no matter how many times they have been blocked. Please check Google's regulations for details.
3. Google Mail passwords are obtained from secondary verification.

The file contains code for text-only transfers, code that can transfer images and its GUI form code.
